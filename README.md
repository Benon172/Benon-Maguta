My data science portfolio

# [Project 1: My-Digits-Classification](https://github.com/Benon172/My-Digits-Classification)
* Determining the Optimal Model and Hyperparameters for classifying Sklearn's Digits dataset
* This is my attempt at finding the best performining classifier along with the parameters for Sklearn's digits dataset. 
* I will continuosly improve the model(s) over time, be it through adding classifiers or optimizing the exiting one(s).

# [Project 2: Tumor type classifier](https://github.com/Benon172/Breast-Cancer)
* Predicting tumor type using Sklearn's breast cancer dataset. 
* I did not have to do a lot of data cleaning and the data was balanced. 
* This was part of my revision of Linear classifiers so I only used the SVM Linear classifier.
